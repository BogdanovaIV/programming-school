- HTML5 - There are different elements, attributes and meta tags to structure content and optimize web pages for search engines. 
- CSS3 - It is used to style elements and create page layout, for animation and responsive design.
- Font Awesome - It is used to paste icons, improve appearance and for web-page functionality. 

## Design

## Color Scheme
  ![Color scheme](documentation/color-scheme.png)

  - Soft shade of blue is used for the background of the navigation bar and the footer. It adds calmness and professionalism.
  - Grey-blue color is applied to font-color and other details. It creates contrast and provides good readability.
  - White is used for the background of some sections and font-color. It creates a bright and open atmosphere, makes content more expressive and improves visual user experience.

## Typography

Font YSText is used for text content as first priority, which provides clarity and ease of perception and makes the text convenient to read. If YSText is unavailable, a browser will use Helvetica, then Arial, and finally standard Sans Serif to provide capability of a wide range of devices and OS.
